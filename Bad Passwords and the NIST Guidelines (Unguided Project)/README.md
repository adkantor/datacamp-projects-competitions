# Bad Passwords and the NIST Guidelines
### Unguided Project at DataCamp
<br>


## Background
Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published [publication 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) titled *Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management*. This publication doesn't tell you what is a *good* password, but it does have specific rules for what is a *bad* password.

In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, using publication 800-63B, you will write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.

## Challenge
You are a data analyst working with the IT team at your company. After a recent data breach, the IT team has decided to strengthen password requirements. They've asked you to write a script to analyze the company's employees logins and identify which employees need to update their password. This will require you to use your string manipulation and regular expression skills.

Your two questions are as follows:

- What percentage of users have invalid passwords?
- Which users need to change their passwords? 

## Requirements
1. **What percentage of users have invalid passwords?**

    Save your answer as a variable, `bad_pass`, in the form of a float rounded up to two decimals (e.g., 0.18).

2. **Which users need to change their passwords?**

    Save your answer as a `pandas` Series consisting of the `usernames` in *alphabetically ascending order* called `email_list`. This will be used to automate email notifications to employees.
