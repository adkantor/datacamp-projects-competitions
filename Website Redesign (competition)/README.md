## Background
### *Which version of the website should you use?*
You work for an early-stage startup in Germany. Your team has been working on a redesign of the landing page. The team believes a new design will increase the number of people who click through and join your site.

They have been testing the changes for a few weeks and now they want to measure the impact of the change and need you to determine if the increase can be due to random chance or if it is statistically significant.

## Challenge
Complete the following tasks:

1. Analyze the conversion rates for each of the four groups: the new/old design of the landing page and the new/old pictures.
1. Can the increases observed be explained by randomness? (Hint: Think A/B test)
1. Which version of the website should they use?
